# PETFrogger : Tutorial 29

## OldSkoolCoder Frogger Game for the Commodore PET

This repository was created after finding the source code for the Frogger game I created while at school.

In those days, games where not allowed to be played on the computers at school, but I managed to get around that rule by writing my own.

The teachers could not stop the kids from playing my own 6502 Assembly writtern game as they were "TESTING" the game (constantly ;) lol)

I hope you enjoy my first game I wrote back in 1983 :D

Enjoy
